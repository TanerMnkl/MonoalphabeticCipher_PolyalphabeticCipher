## Features

- Monoalphabetic Cipher:
  - Encryption and decryption
  - Key-based substitution
  - Frequency analysis with n-grams

- Polyalphabetic Cipher:
  - Encryption and decryption using variable-length keys
  - Brute-force key discovery
  - Strong encryption with large key lengths

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `tqdm` for brute-force progress bars

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install tqdm
